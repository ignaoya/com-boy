Starting out a new game to keep learning c programming with Raylib.

Since I found out Game Off Jam 2020 started yesterday, I joined and
I'll make this game as my submission to the jam.
My brother Matias Oyarzabal will be making music and graphics.

This is my first jam ever. Hope I can finish the game on time.
